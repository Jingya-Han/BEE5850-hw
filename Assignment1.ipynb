    "The town of Owego is concerned about the quality of their groundwater-based drinking water supply. In response, the town would like to consider the feasibility of switching their entire water supply source to surface water. It would be relatively inexpensive to withdraw water from the Owego Creek directly below the Owego Creek near Owego NY streamflow gage (ID # 01514000, see map). However, Owego needs to determine whether environmental flow regulations would make it difficult for them to reliably withdraw water from the Owego Creek. These environmental flow regulations, designed to ensure enough water remains instream to support local aquatic ecosystems, are enforced through water withdrawal permits administered by the NY Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). Staff at DEC put out technical guidance (TOGS for short) that can be used to determine the amount of flow that must remain instream before water can be withdrawn for domestic supply. For those who are interested, the TOGS document is on Canvas. \n",

    "6.\t**(1 pt)** Fit normal, lognormal, and gamma distributions to these data using maximum likelihood. You can use functions designed for MLE from the scipy.stats package: norm.fit(), lognorm.fit(), gamma.fit(). Note that for the lognormal and gamma distributions, scipy.stats assumes by default a 3-parameter version of these models, allowing for a ‘location’ parameter that shifts the whole distribution to the left or right (i.e., moves the lower bound of the distribution above or below zero). In this application, we are going to force this location parameter equal to zero (i.e., we will use 2-parameter versions of these models). You can do this by setting the argument ‘floc’ equal to 0 in your function call when fitting the models. \n",

    "    -Note: The vertical scale of a 'frequency histogram', which is the default version of a histogram, shows the number of observations in each bin. In contrast, the vertical scale of a 'density histogram' shows units that make the total area of all the bars add to 1 (by taking the frequency of each bar in the histogram and dividing by the product of *n* and *w* (the total number of observations and width of each bar, respectively)). This makes it possible to show the probability density curve of a fitted probability distribution using the same vertical scale. \n",
